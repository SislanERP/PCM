# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
staging:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: pcm_staging
  username: ubuntu
  password: <%= Rails.application.secrets[:database][:password] %>
  pool: 5

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: pcm_production
  username: ubuntu
  password: <%= Rails.application.secrets[:database][:password] %>
  pool: 5
